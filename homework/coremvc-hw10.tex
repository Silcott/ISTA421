        \subsection*{Readings}

        Read chapter 10, in the \textit{Pro ASP.NET Core MVC 2} book.
        
        \subsection*{Discussion Questions}

        \paragraph{Summary} From your reading, select five major points that you think are the most important points covered in the chapter. For each point, write a summary of the topic. \textit{Summary} means a good explanation, not just a few words or one sentence, but also not a three page paper. A good paragraph is sufficient. Write your summary as if you wanted to explain the topic to a good friend or your grandmother. 

        \paragraph{Question} After you complete your summary, write a concise question that will elicit a response indicating that the person answering the question understands the topic. The idea is that your question could be a test question on an examination, and that your summary could be the ``correct'' answer.

        \paragraph{Format} Format your homework in MarkDown. Add and commit it to your local git repository, and push the homework up to your Github repository.
